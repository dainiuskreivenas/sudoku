# Sudoku

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9Ã—9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
